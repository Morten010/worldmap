# ðŸŒŽ World Map

My project is a web application that allows users to explore my school's Erasmus trips on a map and read about each trip in detail. The app was built using MapLibre, an open-source mapping library, and React, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

Using the app, users can zoom in and out on the map to see all the different locations where our school has traveled for Erasmus programs. Each location is represented by a pin on the map, and when a user clicks on a pin, they can see more information about that specific trip, including the dates, the countries visited, and any highlights or notable experiences from the trip.

To build this app, I used MapLibre's powerful mapping tools to create a dynamic, interactive map that is easy to navigate and explore. I also used React to create a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, making it easy for anyone to use the app, regardless of their device.

Overall, my Erasmus trip mapping app is a fun and informative way to explore the different places my school has traveled to for Erasmus programs. Whether you're a student, a teacher, or just curious about travel, this app is a great way to learn more about the exciting opportunities available through Erasmus.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
