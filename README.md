# ðŸŒŽ World Map

My project is a web application that allows users to explore my school's Erasmus trips on a map and read about each trip in detail. The app was built using MapLibre, an open-source mapping library, and React, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

Using the app, users can zoom in and out on the map to see all the different locations where our school has traveled for Erasmus programs. Each location is represented by a pin on the map, and when a user clicks on a pin, they can see more information about that specific trip, including the dates, the countries visited, and any highlights or notable experiences from the trip.

To build this app, I used MapLibre's powerful mapping tools to create a dynamic, interactive map that is easy to navigate and explore. I also used React to create a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, making it easy for anyone to use the app, regardless of their device.

Overall, my Erasmus trip mapping app is a fun and informative way to explore the different places my school has traveled to for Erasmus programs. Whether you're a student, a teacher, or just curious about travel, this app is a great way to learn more about the exciting opportunities available through Erasmus.
